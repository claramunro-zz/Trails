# Trails
Interactive Projection, using a Kinect &amp; Video

Trails is an interactive canvas where you are the paintbrush. Trails uses Processing and a Microsoft Kinect to give audiences an exploration of their physical space by using their entire body and expressiveness to paint, play, and engage with others.
To use,
Install both SimpleOpenNI and Kinect Toolkit using the "Add to Library" feature in Processing 2.2.
Then, connect your Kinect and run the sketch.
